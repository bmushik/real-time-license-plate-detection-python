# License Plate Recognition using OpenCV and PyTesseract

This project aims to detect and recognize license plates from images captured by a camera using Python, OpenCV, and PyTesseract.

## About

This project was developed during my internship in 2021 as a practical application of computer vision and OCR technologies. It was aimed at detecting and recognizing license plates from images captured by a camera. The project utilizes Python, OpenCV, and PyTesseract to achieve its goals.

**Internship Date:** February 2021

## Introduction

License Plate Recognition (LPR) is a computer vision task that involves detecting and extracting license plate information from images. This project utilizes OpenCV for image processing tasks like edge detection and contour finding, as well as PyTesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from the license plate.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PyTesseract
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Make sure your webcam is connected to your machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script:
4. The script captures video from the webcam and processes it to detect license plates. Detected license plates are displayed, and the extracted text is shown using PyTesseract. You will be prompted to verify the correctness of the recognized plate.
